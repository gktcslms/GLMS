  - Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object oriented scripting language.
- - Is python a case sensitive language?
  - Yes! Python is a case sensitive programming language.
- - What is tuples in Python?
  - A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parentheses. 
- - What is the difference between tuples and lists in Python?
  - The main differences between lists and tuples are − Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists.
- - What is PEP 8?
  - PEP 8 is a coding convention, a set of recommendation, about how to write your Python code more readable.
- - What is pickling and unpickling?

  - In Python, every name introduced has a place where it lives and can be hooked for. This is known as namespace. It is like a box where a variable name is mapped to the object placed. Whenever the variable is searched out, this box will be searched, to get corresponding object.
- - What is lambda in Python?
  - It is a single expression anonymous function often used as inline function.
- - Why lambda forms in python does not have statements?
  - A lambda form in python does not have statements as it is used to make new function object and then return them at runtime.

  - To copy an object in Python, you can try copy.copy () or copy.deepcopy() for the general case. You cannot copy all objects but most of them.
- - What is negative index in Python?
  - Python sequences can be index in positive and negative numbers. For positive index, 0 is the first index, 1 is the second index and so forth. For negative index, (-1) is the last index and (-2) is the second last index and so forth.
- - How you can convert a number to a string?
  - In order to convert a number into a string, use the inbuilt function str(). If you want a octal or hexadecimal representation, use the inbuilt function oct() or hex().
- - What is the difference between Xrange and range?
  - Xrange returns the xrange object while range returns the list, and uses the same memory and no matter what the range size is.
- - What is module and package in Python?
  - In Python, module is the way to structure program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other modules like objects and attributes.
- - Mention what are the rules for local and global variables in Python?
  - Local variables: If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be local. Global variables: Those variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.
- - How can you share global variables across modules?
  - To share global variables across modules within a single program, create a special module. Import the config module in all modules of your application. The module will be available as a global variable across modules.

- - What is class in Python?
  - Class is a user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.
- - What is class variable in Python?
  - Class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.
- - What is data member in Python?
  - Data member is a class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.

- - What is The range() Function?
  - If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic progressions.<br />Example: for i in range(5)
- - What are function Default Argument Values?
  - The most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to allow.
- - How to Use Lists as Stacks in Python?
  - The list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last element added is the first element retrieved (“last-in, first-out”). To add an item to the top of the stack, use append(). To retrieve an item from the top of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.
- - What is List Comprehensions in Python?
  - List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.
- - What is Nested List Comprehensions?
  - The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension.
- - What is the del statement ?
  - There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment of an empty list to the slice).
- - What is Standard Modules in Python?
  - Python comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library Reference (“Library Reference” hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.
